## I'm building a CI/CD pipeline in 7 days

In this DevOps project I will build my own CI/CD pipeline over 7 projects in 7 days.

## Hold me accountable!

I will set aside 1 hour every day for a week to work on this challenge. I will keep myself accountable by tracking my progress in a journal and sharing updates with my peers. My reward for completing this DevOps challenge will be treating myself to a nice dinner and updating my portfolio with the project.

### What is DevOps?

What is DevOps?

DevOps is all about getting teams to build and deploy code faster without sacrificing reliability. Think of it as a blend of automating tasks, making sure apps are running consistently everywhere, and smart monitoring to catch issues early.
DevOps engineers implement DevOps practices in their organization. DevOps engineers:

- Build automated pipelines (e.g. using AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, GitHub Actions) that test, package, and deploy software, so releases become faster and more reliable.

- Containerize applications using tools like Docker and Kubernetes, which helps applications scale.

- Turn cloud infrastructure into code (e.g. AWS CloudFormation, Terraform), so teams can create and manage resources more efficiently than manually configuring them.

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (or Continuous Deployment).

Continuous Integration is the practice of automatically testing and merging code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository frequently (often several times a day).

Continuous Delivery/Deployment automates the release of this code to production or staging environments.

Goal of CI/CD:
The goal is to speed up and streamline software development by:

Detecting bugs early through automated testing

Reducing integration issues

Releasing updates faster and more reliably

Ensuring consistent, high-quality deployments

In short, CI/CD improves development speed, quality, and efficiency.
