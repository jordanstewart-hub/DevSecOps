## Overview of the Nextwork 7â€‘Day DevOps Challenge: ðŸš€
Over the course of a week, the challenge guides you through building a fully automated DevOps pipeline using AWS tools. Here's a day-by-day breakdown:

Dayâ€¯1 â€“ Launch & Web App Setup
Provision an EC2 instance, SSH into it (e.g. via VSâ€¯Code Remoteâ€‘SSH), and install Java/Maven to generate a basic web app 

Dayâ€¯2 â€“ GitHub Integration
Initialize a local Git repo, connect it to GitHub, configure authentication (token), and push your web app code 

Daysâ€¯3â€“6 â€“ CI/CD Pipeline Assembly
Continue through the series, integrating AWS services like CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and setting up testing automation (not shown explicitly in the condensed sources).

Dayâ€¯7 â€“ Full CI/CD with CodePipeline
Wrap up by deploying the end-to-end workflow using AWS CodePipeline, culminating in automated production-level deployment

### What is DevOps?

What is DevOps?

DevOps is all about getting teams to build and deploy code faster without sacrificing reliability. Think of it as a blend of automating tasks, making sure apps are running consistently everywhere, and smart monitoring to catch issues early.
DevOps engineers implement DevOps practices in their organization. DevOps engineers:

- Build automated pipelines (e.g. using AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, GitHub Actions) that test, package, and deploy software, so releases become faster and more reliable.

- Containerize applications using tools like Docker and Kubernetes, which helps applications scale.

- Turn cloud infrastructure into code (e.g. AWS CloudFormation, Terraform), so teams can create and manage resources more efficiently than manually configuring them.

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (or Continuous Deployment).

Continuous Integration is the practice of automatically testing and merging code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository frequently (often several times a day).

Continuous Delivery/Deployment automates the release of this code to production or staging environments.

Goal of CI/CD:
The goal is to speed up and streamline software development by:

Detecting bugs early through automated testing

Reducing integration issues

Releasing updates faster and more reliably

Ensuring consistent, high-quality deployments

In short, CI/CD improves development speed, quality, and efficiency.
